<div class="warning">

</div>

If you intend to open more than one `.mcap` file via URL you'll need to change the URL manually, you can check how to do it on [this page](./multiple-files.md) of our documentation.


## Local Data 

You can load local files for visualization by: 

* The "Open local file(s)..." in the initial pop up or the menu on the top left;
* You can drag'n drop the files from your OS file manager;

**When dealing with multiple files**, Lichtblick will merge them into a single playback timeline. It's important that they all come from the same data source to avoid potencial data loss or erros during playtime.
