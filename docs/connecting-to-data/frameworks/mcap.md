<div class="warning">
Its important to note that the "Remote file" option it's only viable to open a single link to a file.
</div>

If you intend to open more than one `.mcap` file via URL you'll need to change the URL manually, you can check how to do it on [this page](../multiple-files.md) of our documentation.

## Local Data

You can load local files for visualization by:

- The "Open local file(s)..." in the initial pop up or the menu on the top left;
- You can drag'n drop the files from your OS file manager;

**When dealing with multiple files**, Lichtblick will merge them into a single playback timeline. It's important that they all come from the same data source to avoid potencial data loss or erros during playtime.
